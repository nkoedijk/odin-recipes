    <h5>Green Banana Fries</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 small unripe (green) bananas</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed/li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the bananas using a knife, as they are not ripe and will not peel like a yellow banana. Slice into long thin wedges or strings to make fries.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy deep skillet over medium-high heat. If you have a deep-fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the banana fries into the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oil, and drain on paper towels. Pat off the excess oil, and season with salt. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
